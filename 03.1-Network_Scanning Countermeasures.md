### Countermeasures for Ping Sweep

1. **Firewall Configuration**
   - Configure the firewall to detect and prevent ping sweep attempts instantaneously.

2. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**
   - Use IDS/IPS tools such as Snort to detect and prevent ping-sweep attempts.
   - [Snort](https://www.snort.org)

3. **Evaluate ICMP Traffic**
   - Carefully evaluate the type of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) traffic flowing through enterprise networks.

4. **Connection Termination**
   - Terminate the connection with any host sending more than 10 ICMP ECHO requests.

5. **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) Configuration**
   - Use a DMZ and allow only commands such as ICMP ECHO_REPLY, HOST UNREACHABLE, and TIME EXCEEDED in the DMZ.

6. **Access-Control Lists (ACLs)**
   - Limit ICMP traffic with ACLs to the ISP’s specific IP addresses.

### Countermeasures for Port Scanning

1. **Firewall and IDS Rules**
   - Configure firewall and IDS rules to detect and block probes.
   - Ensure the firewall examines the data in each packet before allowing traffic.

2. **Testing with Port Scanning Tools**
   - Run port scanning tools against hosts to ensure the firewall detects the activity accurately.

3. **Update Firmware**
   - Ensure that router, IDS, and firewall firmware are updated to the latest versions.

4. **Commercial Firewalls**
   - Configure commercial firewalls to protect against fast port scans and SYN floods.

5. **Minimize Open Ports**
   - Keep as few ports open as possible and filter the rest.

6. **Blocking Unwanted Services**
   - Block unwanted services and ensure the service versions running on the ports are non-vulnerable.

7. **Block ICMP Messages**
   - Block inbound ICMP message types and all outbound ICMP type-3 unreachable messages at border routers.

8. **Source Routing**
   - Ensure firewalls and routers block source-routing techniques.

9. **Routing and Filtering Mechanisms**
   - Ensure that routing and filtering mechanisms cannot be bypassed using specific source ports or routing methods.

10. **Network Testing**
    - Test the IP address space using TCP and UDP port scans and ICMP probes.

11. **Anti-Scanning and Anti-Spoofing Rules**
    - Ensure that anti-scanning and anti-spoofing rules are configured.

12. **TCP Wrappers**
    - Ensure TCP wrappers limit access based on domain names or IP addresses.

13. **Fragmented Packets**
    - Test how the network firewall and IDS manage fragmented packets using tools like fragtest and fragroute.

14. **Proxy Servers**
    - Use proxy servers to block fragmented or malformed packets.

15. **Honeypots**
    - Configure firewalls to forward open port scans to empty hosts or honeypots.

16. **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
    - Employ an IPS to identify port scan attempts and blacklist IP addresses.

### Countermeasures for Banner Grabbing

1. **Disabling or Changing Banners**
   - Display false banners to mislead attackers.
   - Turn off unnecessary services to limit information disclosure.
   - Use server masking tools to disable or change banner information.
   - Remove unnecessary HTTP headers and response data.

2. **Apache Configuration**
   - Use directives in the httpd.conf file to change banner information.
   - Set `ServerSignature` to `Off` in the httpd.conf file.
   - Modify `ServerTokens` from `Full` to `Prod` in Apache’s httpd.conf file.

3. **Windows Configuration**
   - Modify `RemoveServerHeader` in the UrlScan.ini config file to prevent server version disclosure.
   - Use `AlternateServerName` to trick attackers.

4. **Disable Unnecessary HTTP Methods**
   - Disable methods such as `Connect`, `Put`, `Delete`, and `Options` from web application servers.

5. **Remove X-Powered-By Header**
   - Remove the X-Powered-By header using the customHeaders option in the `<system.webServer>` section of the web.config file.

6. **Hiding File Extensions**
   - Hide file extensions to mask web technology.
   - Replace application mappings such as `.asp` with `.htm` or `.foo` to disguise server identities.
   - Apache users can use mod_negotiation directives.
   - IIS users can use tools such as PageXchanger to manage file extensions.
