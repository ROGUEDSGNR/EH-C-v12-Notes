## SNMP Enumeration Countermeasures

- Remove the SNMP agent or turn off the SNMP service.
- If turning off SNMP is not an option, change the default community string names.
- Upgrade to SNMPv3, which encrypts passwords and messages.
- Implement the Group Policy security option called “Additional restrictions for anonymous connections.”
- Ensure that access to null session pipes, null session shares, and IPsec filtering is restricted.
- Block access to TCP/UDP port 161.
- Do not install the management and monitoring Windows component unless required.
- Encrypt or authenticate using IPsec.
- Do not misconfigure the SNMP service with read-write authorization.
- Configure access-control lists (ACLs) for all SNMP connections to allow only legitimate users to access SNMP devices.
- Regularly audit the network traffic.
- Encrypt credentials using the “AuthNoPriv” mode, which uses MD5 and SHA for additional protection.
- Modify the registry to allow only restricted or permitted access to the SNMP community name.
- Change the default password and periodically change the current password.
- Identify all the SNMP devices with read/write permissions and provide read-only permissions to specific devices that do not require read/write permissions.
- Avoid using the “NoAuthNoPriv” mode as it does not encrypt communications.

## LDAP Enumeration Countermeasures

- Use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or STARTTLS technology to encrypt LDAP traffic.
- Select a username different from the email address and enable account lockout.
- Restrict access to Active Directory (AD) by using software such as Citrix.
- Use NT LAN Manager (NTLM), Kerberos, or any basic authentication mechanism to limit access to legitimate users.
- Log access to Active Directory (AD) services.
- Block users from accessing certain AD entities by changing the permissions on those objects/attributes.
- Deploy canary accounts, which resemble real accounts, to mislead attackers.
- Create decoy groups with the word “Admin” in the name to mislead attackers.

## NFS Enumeration Countermeasures

- Implement proper permissions (read/write must be restricted to specific users) in exported file systems.
- Implement firewall rules to block NFS port 2049.
- Ensure proper configuration of files such as /etc/smb.conf, /etc/exports, and /etc/hosts.allow to protect the data stored in the server.
- Log the requests to access the system files on the NFS server.
- Keep the root_squash option in the /etc/exports file turned ON so that no requests made as root on the client are trusted.
- Implement NFS tunneling through SSH to encrypt the NFS traffic over the network.
- Implement the principle of least privileges to mitigate threats such as data modification, data addition, and the modification of configuration files by normal users.
- Ensure that users are not running suid and sgid on the exported file system.
- Ensure that the NIS netgroup has a fully defined hostname to prevent the granting of higher access to other hosts.

## SMTP Enumeration Countermeasures

- Ignore email messages to unknown recipients.
- Exclude sensitive information on mail servers and local hosts in mail responses.
- Disable the open relay feature.
- Limit the number of accepted connections from a source to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Disable the EXPN, VRFY, and RCPT TO commands or restrict them to authenticated users.
- Identify spammers through machine learning (ML) solutions.
- Do not share internal IP/host information or mail relay system information.

## SMB Enumeration Countermeasures

- Disable SMB on web and DNS servers by disabling the properties Client for Microsoft Networks and File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks in Network and Dial-up Connections.
- On servers accessible from the Internet (bastion hosts), disable SMB by disabling the same two properties of the TCP/IP properties dialog box or block TCP ports 139 and 445.
- Configure the Windows Registry to limit anonymous access from the Internet by adding the RestrictNullSessAccess parameter to the registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters`.
- Ensure Windows Firewall or similar endpoint protection systems are enabled.
- Install the latest security patches for Windows and third-party software.
- Implement a proper authentication mechanism with a strong password policy.
- Implement strong permissions to keep stored information safe.
- Perform regular audits of system logs and active system monitoring.
- Implement secure VPNs for remote access.
- Employ file behavioral analysis systems such as next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) to observe traffic patterns.
- Implement digitally signed data transmission for accessing SMB resources.
- Block/disable TCP ports 88, 139, and 445 and UDP ports 88, 137, and 138.
- Enable public profile settings in the firewall system.

## FTP Enumeration Countermeasures

- Implement secure FTP (SFTP using SSH) or FTP secure (FTPS using SSL) to encrypt FTP traffic.
- Implement strong passwords or a certification-based authentication policy.
- Ensure unrestricted file uploading on the FTP server is not allowed.
- Disable anonymous FTP accounts. If not possible, monitor anonymous FTP accounts regularly.
- Restrict access by IP or domain name to the FTP server.
- Configure access controls on authenticated FTP accounts using ACLs.
- Restrict login attempts and time.
- Configure ingress and egress filtering rules for FTP services.
- Use SSL/FTPS for authenticated FTP accounts.
- Do not run regular public services such as mail or web on a single FTP server.
- Implement a Markov game-based analysis model for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing (VAPT) on cloud-based FTP servers.

## DNS Enumeration Countermeasures

- Restrict resolver access to hosts inside the network to prevent external cache poisoning.
- Randomize source ports, query IDs, and the alphabet case of domain names in request packets to defend against cache poisoning.
- Audit DNS zones to identify vulnerabilities and address DNS-related issues.
- Patch known vulnerabilities and update nameservers with the latest versions of software such as BIND and Microsoft DNS.
- Monitor nameservers to identify malicious activities or unexpected behaviors.
- Restrict DNS zone transfers to specific slave nameserver IP addresses.
- Use different servers for authoritative and resolving functions to reduce overload and prevent DoS attacks.
- Use isolated and dedicated servers for DNS services to minimize the risk of web application attacks.
- Disable DNS recursion in the DNS server configuration to restrict queries from other domains.
- Harden the OS by closing unused ports and blocking unnecessary services.
- Use a VPN for secure communication and change default passwords.
- Implement two-factor authentication for secure access when a DNS server is managed by a third party.
- Use DNS change lock or client lock to restrict DNS settings alterations without authorization.
- Implement DNSSEC for additional security by allowing only digitally signed DNS requests.
- Use premium DNS registration services that hide sensitive information from the public.
- Ensure private hosts and their IP addresses are not published in the DNS zone files of the public DNS server.
- Use standard network admin contacts for DNS registrations to avoid social engineering attacks.
- Prune DNS zone files to avoid revealing unnecessary information.
- Maintain independent internal and external DNS servers.
- Ensure old or unused DNS records are deleted periodically.
- Restrict version.bind request queries using ACLs.
- Use the /etc/hosts file for development or staging subdomains instead of DNS records.
